I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Physics Department at the University of Pennsylvania, working in the Arnold Mathijssen Group. My research focuses on bacteria swimming in complex flow networks, including rheotaxis, chemotaxis, and phototaxis.

Broadly, I am interested in active matter, soft condensed matter, and biophysics. I use a combination of microfluidic experiments, image analysis, and numerical simulations to understand how microorganisms interact with complex environments and how their collective behavior shapes transport and mixing at small scales.
